# misc-data-science-projects
Here's my collection of notebooks I've made for any of my open-source data science projects involving data transformation, analysis, visualization, and/or machine learning. I primarily use these notebooks for my own self-reference but anyone who stumbles upon this repo is more than welcome to use anything in here in any manner they wish.

## Machine Learning

### Yelp Dataset: Predicting Star Ratings Using Support Vector Machines

[Link to Notebook.](https://github.com/robaleman/misc-data-science-projects/blob/master/Yelp-Rating-Classification.ipynb)

SVM classifier on the public Yelp dataset that uses natural language processing (TF-IDF algorithm) to predict how many stars a review will get. Some visualization of the most common words used in highly-rated or poorly-rated reviews. (Python).

## Tutorials

### Tutorial: Google Cloud Natural Language API
[Link to Notebook.](https://github.com/robaleman/misc-data-science-projects/blob/master/Google-Cloud-Sentiment-Demo.ipynb)

Tutorial for the Google Cloud Natural Language API. Gives a demo of how to use the API to tokenize texts, parse them for sentiment scores, and demonstrates some possible ideas for visualizations (Python).

### Tutorial: Requests and Data Management with NHL API
[Link to Notebook.](https://github.com/robaleman/misc-data-science-projects/blob/master/NHL-Data-Retrieval.ipynb)

Tutorial for using the requests library to retrieve data from APIs. Simple notebook for reference and examples. (Python).

## Exploratory Analysis / Visualizations

### Annotated Heat Maps and Dendrogams in R
[Link to Notebook (Coming Soon).]

Demonstration of cluster-based visualization on a chemical dataset. Includes visualization through heat maps, dendrogams, annotations, and more. (R).

### Time Series Analysis of App Userbase
[Link to Notebook ().]

Population analysis on the user logs for a medical app. User base (both long-term and short-term) is estimated using device and profile IDs. Includes population estimation and time series visualization. (Python).

### EDA: Investigation on Recreational Drug Use
[Link to Notebook.](https://github.com/robaleman/misc-data-science-projects/blob/master/Drugs-Prevalence%20and%20Demographics.ipynb)

Exploratory analysis of the prevalence of recreational drug use in the US based on the publicly avalilable National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH). Includes comparison of means, data management, and lots of data visualization in Matplotlib/Seaborn. (Python).

### EDA: Census Comparison Between Three Cities in Tennessee
[Link to Notebook.](https://github.com/robaleman/misc-data-science-projects/blob/master/TN_City_Demographics.ipynb)

Simple data visualizations of income and demographics from three different cities in Tennessee: one rural town, one mid-sized suburban city, and one urban metropolitan area. Data retrieved from the 2016 American Community Survey released by the US Census Bureau. (Python).
