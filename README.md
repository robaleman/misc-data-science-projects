Here's my collection of notebooks I've made for various data science projects involving data analysis, data visualization, or machine learning. 

## Machine Learning

### Yelp Dataset: Predicting Star Ratings Using Support Vector Machines

[Link to Notebook.](https://github.com/robaleman/misc-data-science-projects/blob/master/Yelp-Rating-Classification.ipynb)

SVM classifier on the public Yelp dataset that uses natural language processing (TF-IDF algorithm) to predict how many stars a review will get. Some visualization of the most common words used in highly-rated or poorly-rated reviews. (Python).

## Exploratory Analysis / Other

### Tutorial: Google Cloud Natural Language API
[Link to Notebook.](https://github.com/robaleman/misc-data-science-projects/blob/master/Google-Cloud-Sentiment-Demo.ipynb)

Tutorial for the Google Cloud Natural Language API. Gives a demo of how to use the API to tokenize texts, parse them for sentiment scores, and demonstrates some possible ideas for visualizations (Python).

### Investigation on Recreational Drug Use
[Link to Notebook.](https://github.com/robaleman/misc-data-science-projects/blob/master/Drugs-Prevalence%20and%20Demographics.ipynb)

Exploratory analysis of the prevalence of recreational drug use in the US based on the publicly avalilable National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH). Includes comparison of means, data management, and lots of data visualization in Matplotlib/Seaborn. (Python).
